# EVM Subnet Deployment Guide

Welcome to the EVM Subnet Deployment Guide for Avalanche using the Avalanche CLI. This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your own EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) subnet, adding it to Metamask, connecting Remix to your Metamask, deploying smart contracts, and testing your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Avalanche CLI installed on your system
- Metamask extension installed in your browser
- Remix IDE (or any other preferred IDE for Solidity development)
- Basic knowledge of Ethereum smart contract development

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Your EVM Subnet Using the Avalanche CLI**:
   - Follow the instructions provided by Avalanche CLI to deploy your EVM subnet.

2. **Add Your Subnet to Metamask**:
   - Open Metamask in your browser.
   - Go to Networks > Custom RPC.
   - Enter the details of your EVM subnet (RPC URL, Chain ID, Symbol, and Block Explorer URL).

3. **Select Your Subnet in Metamask**:
   - Ensure that your newly added subnet is selected as the active network in Metamask.

4. **Connect Remix to Your Metamask**:
   - Open Remix IDE.
   - Choose "Injected Web3" as the environment to connect Remix to Metamask.

5. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
   - Write your smart contracts in Remix or import existing ones.
   - Compile and deploy your smart contracts to your EVM subnet using Remix.

6. **Test Your Application**:
   - Using Remix, interact with your deployed smart contracts.
   - Deploy tokens, pools, or any other components of your application.
   - Perform thorough testing to ensure the functionality of your application on the EVM subnet.
